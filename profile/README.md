# Efrei Web Services

*Efrei Web Sevices is a project carried out outside the academic framework, during the free time of 3 students from EFREI Paris.*

## Introduction

Efrei Web Services (EWS) is an association aimed at providing a private cloud service tailored to the needs of Efrei students.

It is currently led by three students, forming the association's executive committee:

- **President** - Thomas PEUGNET, M1 Apprenticeship in Networks and Security
- **Treasurer** - Thimot VEYRE, M2 Cloud Architecture
- **Secretary** - Dorian TURGOT, M1 Initial Training

## Services

*The project is currently under development. Some functionalities were tested by two groups of L3 students to demonstrate the platform's concept. These tests took place in May 2023, revealing genuine interest in the project.*

The official launch of the platform is planned for the start of the 2023 school year.

### **September 2023**

#### **Web Hosting**

The idea is to offer web hosting services to Efrei students so they can host their academic and extracurricular projects as part of their education (Portfolio, CV, project submissions, etc.).

Each student would have a dedicated 1GB storage capacity for the files constituting their various projects.

In addition to web hosting, automatic indexing of the student's different projects on Google will be offered.

#### **Online Storage**

Efrei Web Services also aims to provide an online storage server similar to a "Drive." Each student would have a storage space with a capacity of 5GB (for now). The goal is not to replace the currently implemented OneDrive by the school but to offer a server with a protocol better suited for automation needs.

#### **Planned Services for the Future**

After the official launch, we plan to add several additional services, including:

- A virtual "mini-server" (per user), with a terminal based on Linux.
- A private and encrypted "WeTransfer" service with more attractive file size limits than those offered by public services.
